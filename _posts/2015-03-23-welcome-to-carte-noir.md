Welcome to my first blog post. 

I would first like to point out that I LOVE all feedback on the work that I do. So please if you have any comments or suggestions on any posts, feel free to offer your comments below. For this blog posts I will be diving into one of my first projects I did in Data Analytics school that involved Python. I have attached the link to this project [here](https://github.com/Mvillarreal88/Bank-and-Polling-Python-Analysis-)

The theme has been designed with simplicity and readability in mind. It makes
use of third party services such as Disqus ad AddThis to ensure the blog has
all the features you would expect from a dynamic application such as Wordpress
but with the hosting and maintenance simplicity of Jekyll.
